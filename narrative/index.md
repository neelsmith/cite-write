# Concepts

The CITE architecture is built on simple concepts: scholarly resources are identified by permanent canonical identifiers; you can use those identifiers to find content in a library of scholarly material of diverse kinds.  When the library is digital, these simple concepts can offer surpisingly powerful ways to explore complex content.


The following pages introduce a translation of these simple ideas into code, with working examples.  The parallel Pluto notebooks setup a hands-on environment for exploring the code further.

## Citation

- [citation](./citation/): concepts
    - [citing objects](./citation/cite2urn/): the `CtsUrn`

## Citable content

- [citable content](./citables/): concepts
    - [citable passages of text](./citables/texts/): the `CitablePassage`
